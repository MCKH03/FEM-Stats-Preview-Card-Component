# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). I did it all by myself and had a lot of fun doing it! Also I made a nice modern hamburger menu😎

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Sass
- SCSS

### What I learned

There were many things that I learned during coding this little project specially when I was trying to build my little hamburger menu.

Also I learned some great tricks using background-images such as using padding-top or padding-bottom instead of height of these kind of images.

I also used my new learned skill SASS to implement this mini project and I guess I did a good job actually😅

I hope you enjoy the overall look of what I built!

### Continued development

I think I'm gonna build more menus like the one I built in this one because I learned a lot building it on my own and use more modern effects in them. Also at this time, I'm also learning JavaScript and in the future I will use JS in my projects too!
